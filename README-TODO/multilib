We'll have to expand mono_multilib_comply to also cover /usr/bin/ scripts (And .config files?)
egrep "/lib(/|$)" $(equery files mono-tools|grep /usr/bin|grep -v debug)|sed -r -e ":/lib(/|$): s:/(lib)(/|$):/\164\2:"
^works

Find out if they're what we want:
loki mdoctest # file /usr/bin/podsleuth
/usr/bin/podsleuth: Bourne-Again shell script text executable
loki mdoctest # nano /usr/bin/podsleuth
loki mdoctest # file /usr/bin/podsleuth
/usr/bin/podsleuth: POSIX shell script text executable

LC_ALL=C egrep -r --include='*.dll.config' --include='*.exe.config' '/lib/' /usr/lib64/
/usr/lib64/mono/gac/monodoc/1.0.0.0__0738eb9f132ed756/monodoc.dll.config:        <path docsPath="/usr/lib/monodoc" />
^Only occurence.

We should make mono_multilib_comply generally use only mv to move files around, it's much cheaper. The reason cp -ar is
there now, is gtk-sharp-gapi. Perhaps an override?
